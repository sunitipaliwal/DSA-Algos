## ðŸ“– How to Use This Guide

1. _Topic-wise Practice_: Focus on one topic at a time and solve multiple problems from that category
2. _Algorithm Understanding_: Study the algorithm first, then implement it from scratch
3. _Pattern Recognition_: Many problems follow similar patterns - learn to identify them
4. _Time Complexity_: Always analyze and optimize your solutions
5. _Edge Cases_: Test your solutions with various edge cases

## ðŸŽ¯ Study Tips

- Start with easier problems and gradually move to harder ones
- Implement algorithms from scratch before looking at solutions
- Practice explaining your approach - this helps in interviews
- Time yourself to improve problem-solving speed
- Review and revise previously solved problems regularly
